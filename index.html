<img src="C:\Users\getan\Downloads\Fortnite_chapter2_EN_11BR_KeyArt_Social-1920x1080-9d78e7401fe1b6f437143196bdb4e91c412ce23a.jpg" alt="Chapter 2" width="500">
<p>Fortnite has introduced a lot of shotguns in a very short time in chapter 2. So today, we are going to break it down and show the 5 best shotguns in the game</p>
<h2> 5. The charge shotgun</h2>
<img src="C:\Users\getan\Downloads\Charge.jpeg" alt="Charge shotgun. credit:Epic games" width="500">
<p> the charge shotgun was added in season 3, and is the 50/50 most loved/hated shotgun ever. It's clunky charge mechanics and the fact that there is only 3 pellets in one round made this gun a nightmare. But, seeing the<br>high body shot damge, this weapon could be deadly in the right hands. the mythic charge shotgun(avalible in catty's corner) was the shotgun everyone wanted to make<br> a dash for, and this weapon made catty a hot drop
with almost no loot. also, it paired well with the mythic shockwave launcher.</p>
<h2> 4. The Tactical shotgun</h2>
<img src="C:\Users\getan\Downloads\960x0.jpg" alt="Tac shotgun in fortnite" width="500">
<p>The Tactical Shotgun is a Shotgun in Battle Royale that is available in Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, and Legendary variants.
 It uses Shells and has a headshot multiplier of x1.5.
 It is fully automatic and fires faster than the Pump Shotgun and Charge Shotgun but slower than the Combat Shotgun, Double Barrel Shotgun and Drum Shotgun.</p>
<h2> 3. The double barrel shotgun</h2>
<img src="C:\Users\getan\Downloads\new-shotgun-double-barrell-fortnite.jpg" alt="Double barrel shotgun" width="500">
<p>The Double Barrel Shotgun was a shotgun in Fortnite Battle Royale. 
It is available in Epic and Legendary variants.
 It uses Shells 'n' Slugs.
 The shotgun yields very high damage at close range, but has the drawback of a large spread, slow reload time, and very low range.
 The Double Barrel Shotgun was introduced in Patch 5.20 and vaulted in Patch 7.00, because it was an unbalanced shotgun and to rebalance the loot pool.
 The Double Barrel Shotgun made an appearance for 24 hours during the 14 Days of Summer event on July 5th after the unvaulting of the Bottle Rockets, and then being unvaulted permanently in Patch 10.00 Content Update, but was only available in Tilted Town.
 With the removal of Tilted Town in the Batman Update, the Double Barrel Shotgun has been added back to the vault. 
It has a 1.25x headshot multiplier, a reload time of over 2.7 seconds, and a 2 second cooldown timer when switching to other shotguns.</p>
<a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Tilted_Town#:~:text=Floor%20loot&text=Tilted%20Town%20was%20a%20location,Rift%20Beacon%20in%20Season%20X.&text=On%20September%2021%2C%202019%2C%20the,the%20Fortnite%20X%20Batman%20crossover.">Read more about tilted town</a>
<h2> 2. The combat shotgun </h2>
<img src="C:\Users\getan\Downloads\download.jfif" alt="Combat shotgun" width="500">
<p>Combat Shotgun is a semi-automatic shotgun in Battle Royale added in Season 9.
 It replaced the Pump Shotgun in the 9.00 patch.
 It is available in Rare, Epic, and Legendary variants.
 It uses Shells as ammunition, it can hold 8 bullets at one time, fires 10 pellets in a spread, and has a headshot multiplier of 1.5x.
 It has a very tight bullet spread, which makes it much harder to hit shots at close range.
 However, this and its very low damage dropoff used to allow it to deal damage at over 100 meters until it was nerfed to 60 meters.</p>

<img src="C:\Users\getan\Downloads\d2f87-15951387100042-800.jpg" alt="pump shotgun" The Pump Shotgun" width="500">
<p>Pump Shotgun is a Shotgun in Battle Royale. It is available in Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. It uses Shells as ammo, has a headshot multiplier of x2 and fires ten pellets in a spread to do damage.
   Firing from a limited magazine, the Pump Shotgun outputs immense damage up close, but very slowly. It is completely lacking in ranged combat ability and does not constantly shoot when the trigger is held down.</p>
